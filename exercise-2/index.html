      Hello

    <h2>Bad Repetition</h2>

    <p>
      One of the biggest failures in the design of the Amazon ECommerce feed is how busy the search results page is. This page
      design breaks the repetition design principle because the search results design is not consistent as you scrpl down the page.
      It's not until you reach the second page of search results that you are left with a continuous feed of products. Another issue that is
      related to alignment is that each row in the feed occupies a different width. The first row which looks like it is
      an advertisement only goes half way across the window showing three products. The next row fills the entire width, but
      each product item now has a price, delivery date, and more busy information that was not present in the products from the first row. The next
      row on this page continues to break this principle of repetition because now there is title to this section called "Editorial recommendations",
      which has not been seen in any of the previous rows. Additionally, this section does not fill the entire width of the screen. This page that
      continues to break the reptition principle by having varying heights for each section. To improve it, I would make sure
      that each row has consistent feed units so that there aren't varying levels of height.

      For my 6.033 assignment, we were looking at one of the CSAIL group's website. While clicking around on the main reason why this page fails the constrast page is because all the text is in a teal color. I found this page at <a href="http://lirone.csail.mit.edu/~dcurtis">http://lirone.csail.mit.edu/~dcurtis/</a>. 
      The main reason why this page fails the constrast page is because all the text is in a <span style="color: teal;">teal color</span>. While there is contast in heading, spacing, and font size,
      the principle for contrast doesn't apply here because the color doesn't provide any special focus or attention to a certain aspect of the page 
      since the entire page is the same color. If anything, the hyperlinks stand out because they are the item that has a different color. To fix this, the uniform color should be a normal black text color,
      and the teal color (or really any color), can be used for headings or links if the intended function is for attention and focus.
