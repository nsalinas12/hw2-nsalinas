    One of the strongest aspects of AirBnb is that their user interface is very clean, modern, and responsive. Their web
    layout succeeds in the contrast, alignment, and repetition. The screen is split in half with a map showing all the rentals
    available from the search query on the map.<br>
    This interface also has very good learnability because when a user starts interacting with the web app, the page is very response. 
    The filter buttons will change in style when you hover over them, the map is draggable and the cursor changes when you 
    hover over the map, when you press down on the map, and when you release the map after dragging it. Also, when you scroll over
    the listings on the left side of the page, that specific price on the map will change color to give feedback to the user of which 
    listing they are looking at. <br>
    Overall, this interface deserves a spot on the UI Hall of Fame for succeeding in multiple design principles including alignment, 
    repetition, and this interface gives a lot of feedback to the user when they hover and/or click on different features of the interface.

  <h1>UI Hall of Shame</h1>

    <p>
      One of the first failures on learnability from craigslist is that the landing page is just a 
      list of categories and subcategories of listings. For the purposes of this exercise, I decided to mimic
      what we were looking for in the AirBnB example, which was a two-bedroom rental apartment in Boston. It's hard to scan through all the categories
