    One of the strongest aspects of AirBnb is that their user interface is very clean, modern, and responsive. Their web
    layout succeeds in the contrast, alignment, and repetition. The screen is split in half with a map showing all the rentals
    available from the search query on the map.<br>
    This interface also has very good learnability because when a user starts interacting with the web app, the page is very response. 
    The filter buttons will change in style when you hover over them, the map is draggable and the cursor changes when you 
    hover over the map, when you press down on the map, and when you release the map after dragging it. Also, when you scroll over
    the listings on the left side of the page, that specific price on the map will change color to give feedback to the user of which 
    listing they are looking at. <br>
    Overall, this interface deserves a spot on the UI Hall of Fame for succeeding in multiple design principles including alignment, 
    repetition, and this interface gives a lot of feedback to the user when they hover and/or click on different features of the interface.

  <h1>UI Hall of Shame</h1>

    <p>
      One of the first failures on learnability from craigslist is that the landing page is just a 
      list of categories and subcategories of listings. For the purposes of this exercise, I decided to mimic
      what we were looking for in the AirBnB example, which was a two-bedroom rental apartment in Boston. It's 
      hard to scan through all the categories since all of them are formatted to be hyperlinks. <br>
      When selecting vacation rentals, the alignment is off for the map,and the map doesn't actually preview any 
      listings. When you go to click on the map, it starts off with the entire North east region. This prompts the user
      to continuously click on the map until they reach the region where they are at. <br>
      This website also shows bad learnability because it's very hard to find which all the filters. Some are drop down on the left
      and others are just entering numbers. The search also immediately updates when you change a filter. It would be better if all the filters
      had the same format (repetition) and that the search was updated once the "Update search" button was updated.
